# binance-simple-tracker

As simple as it is, it's not intended to work with all pairs on binance and it hasn't been coded in that way, I just made it for myself to check things at my own way, made on python 3.8.

Put your API Key and API Secret, you can find it here https://www.binance.com/en/my/settings/api-management , and put in on the script, no binaries are provided for download.

You all can rework it in your own way, nothing special as I said.

You can use it for whatever you want have a nice day/night.
